        <h2 id="intro1">What is RevSpace</h2>
        <p>RevSpace is a web app that helps you make a calendar that when imported to Google calendar, helps schedule
            revision dates for spaced repetition</p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="intro2">What is spaced repetition</h2>
        <p>
            To know what spaced repetition method is, lets learn about something first.
            <br>
            When you learn something, you tend to forget it after a few days, i.e. it decays, starting from an hour
            after you've learned it.
        <figure>
            <img src="images/Graph-1024x788.png" alt="forgetting curve">
            <figcaption>Src- maestrolearning.com</figcaption>

        </figure>

        The above image shows how huch information you retain over time (unless you are a genius who remembers
        everything).
        <br>As you can see, you forget what you learned over time.
        <br>To combat this, there are a lot of memorization or retention techniques one of which, is Spaced Repetition.

        </p>
        <p>Spaced Repetition helps you remember what you learned for a longer time</p>


        <h2 id="intro3">How spaced repetition works</h2>
        <p>Spaced Repetition involves having the learner actively recall what you learned from memory at gradually
            increasing intervals.</p>
        <p>At each interval, after recalling, review your performance, see what you missed and then add more
            information(what you missed and also what you didn't)</p>
        <img src="images/spaced%20rep.webp" alt="">
        <figcaption>A time vs retention graph</figcaption>
        <p>This graph shows how after each iteration or after each recall, information is retained for a longer period,
            but the next review happens before your memory of the information decays significantly.</p>
        <p>After a few repetitions (iterations) the curve flattens out, i.e. you remember it for long time.</p>

        <h2 id="intro4">How are the intervals scheduled</h2>
        <p>Now there are quite a few methods like</p>
        <ol>
            <li>SM-2</li>
            <p>Revise on 1, 7, 16, and 35 days after learning</p>
            <li>i111 method</li>
            <p>Revise immediately after, 1 day, 1 week and then 1 month after learning</p>
            <li>My method</li>
            <p>This is a combination method that is useful for both easy and hard topics.
                <br>
                It has 9 iterations.
            <ol>
                <li>Immediately after</li>
                <li>1 day later</li>
                <li>7 days later</li>
                <li>14 days later</li>
                <li>21 days later</li>
                <li>30 days later</li>
                <li>60 days later</li>
                <li>120 days later</li>
                <li>180 days later</li>

            </ol>
            Its not too steep, though it might feel slow for some.
            </p>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="intro5">How this web app works?</h2>
        <p>This app, takes your topics with starting date and time with your timezone.
            <br>
            It then takes this data, calculates dates for next revisions and creates an ICS(Internet Calendaring and
            Scheduling) file which you can import into your calendars.
            <br>
            When imported, your revisions are scheduled into calendars instead of doing it manually</p>
        <p>p.s. None of your date is collected or stored, everything happens on your side during your session. Deleting
            the list or reloading the window will erase everything.</p>
        <br>
        Guide:
        <ol>
            <li>Timezone</li>
            <p>Your timezone is detected automatically, but if you want to choose another one just check the <a
                    href="">Timezone list</a>, change it and press Set Timezone button </p>
            <button>Set Timezone</button>
            <li>Topics</li>
            <p>These are the actual topics you want to revise,
                <br>
                input the Topic, its starting date is present day by default(which you can change) and set the starting
                time.</p>
            <p>To add more topics, press Add More Topics button
                <button>Add More Topics</button>
            </p>
            <p>To add all topics to the list, press Add All Topics button
                <button>Add All Topics</button>
            </p>

            <li>Topics list</li>
            <p>This is a table that displays all your topics with its title, starting date and dates for the upcoming
                revisions.</p>
            <p>At the end of each row, there is a delete icon
                <button>üóëÔ∏è</button>
                whuch is visible when you hover over it.
            </p>
            <p>Below the list is the Delete List button
                <button>Delete List</button>
                which deletes the entire list
            </p>

            <li>Download ICS</li>
            <p>This button
                <button>Download ICS</button>
                when pressed, initiates the download of ICS file
            </p>

            <li>Add to Google Calendar</li>
            <p>This button opens the google calendar import/export page in a new tab where you can import your ICS
                file.</p>
            <p>Or you can do this manually in the calendar you want if it has a feature to import ics files. </p>


        </ol>

        <h2 id="intro6">Note</h2>
        <p>I will be adding more features as I think of them or as necessary, if you have any suggestions, send them <a
                href="feedback.html">here</a>.</p>
